# Mine and Rock Prediction using SONAR (ML Model)

An intelligent machine learning-based system to classify SONAR signals as **Mine** or **Rock**, helping enhance the safety of **underwater submarines** by reducing manual efforts and human error. This is a full-stack project with a trained **Random Forest** model in the backend and an interactive simulation interface in the frontend.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project uses a machine learning model trained on SONAR data to detect whether an underwater object is a **Mine** or a **Rock** based on the intensity of sound wave reflections (SONAR returns). The system is designed with the goal of improving **naval safety** and minimizing risks from manually interpreting SONAR signals.

- **Dataset**: 208 rows √ó 61 columns  
  - **Features (60)**: Numerical intensity values normalized between 0 and 1  
  - **Label (1)**: `M` for Mine and `R` for Rock
  - **Source**: `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rupakroy/sonarcsv`

- **ML Model**: Random Forest Classifier  
- **Backend**: Flask API to serve the trained ML model  
- **Frontend**: React.js simulation with visual + audio alerts

## üß† Features

### ‚úÖ Manual Prediction  
- Users can input 60 feature values to check whether the object is a Mine or Rock.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Simulation Mode  
- A sequence of predictions is run iteratively.
- If a **Rock** is detected: the simulation continues normally.
- If a **Mine** is detected: a **beep sound warning** is triggered until acknowledged by the user.
